## Factorization Methods: PLU, LDL, Cholesky, QR
- factorization.ipynb

We explore four different factorization methods in linear algebra- the backbone of data processing- and observe the strengths & weaknesses of the approaches when addressing square vs rectangular matrices, and the significance of the order of operations per approach.

## Iterative Methods: Gauss-Seidel, Conjugate Gradient
- iterative-methods.ipynb

We explore two principal iterative methods in solving linear algebra problems and use various problem configurations to compare & contrast the two approaches. We begin to see a trade-off in accuracy and performance.

## Finding Eigenvalues: QR, SVD
- finding-eigenvals.ipynb

We explore the Gram-Shmidt Orthogonalization Process (QR Factorization) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) techniques in determining the Î»s (eigenvalues) of matrices and matrix multiplication. Here we can see how linear independence affects eigenfactorization. This forms the basis for extracting meaningful relationships between the data in a data set.
