## Factorization Methods: PLU, LDL, Cholesky, QR
- factorization.ipynb

We explore four different factorization methods in linear algebra- the backbone of data processing- and observe the strengths & weaknesses of the approaches when addressing square vs rectangular matrices, and the significance of the order of operations per approach.

## Iterative Methods: Gauss-Seidel, Conjugate Gradient
- iterative-methods.ipynb

We explore two principal iterative methods in solving linear algebra problems and use various problem configurations to compare & contrast the two approaches. We begin to see a trade-off in accuracy and performance.
